        -> summary: how to set up a test gmail account for less secure apps  
    -> in this lesson, you'll set up a secondary email account for your python-flask app  
    -> a secondary gmail account is useful for testing and avoids risking your personal email security  
    -> you don't have to use gmail; the lesson covers gmail-specific steps, but smtp setup may vary for other platforms  

    -> set up a gmail account for your app  
        -> step 1: create a gmail account  
            -> head to the gmail home page and click "create an account"  

        -> step 2: enter account details  
            -> enter a unique email and choose a username; make sure to remember your password  
            -> use any first or last name as long as it's appropriate  

        -> step 3: configure settings  
            -> complete the setup and access your inbox  
            -> click the settings gear in the top right corner  
            -> in the settings menu, click "accounts and import" then "other google account settings"  

        -> step 4: turn less secure apps on  
            -> in the "security" tab, scroll down to "less secure app access"  
            -> turn "allow less secure apps" to on; this is needed for sending emails from flask  
            -> if you can't find this option, continue to the next step  

        -> step 5: enable two-factor authentication  
            -> go to "2-step verification" to enable two-factor authentication  
            -> enter your phone number for security codes, or choose another security method like google authenticator  

        -> step 6: create app password  
            -> once two-factor authentication is enabled, scroll down to "signing in to google"  
            -> click "app passwords" and select "other (custom name)"  
            -> name the app (e.g., "flask-webdev") and generate a 16-character app password  
            -> write down the app password for use in your flask app to authenticate with google's smtp server  

    -> now you're ready to configure flask-mail to send emails and receive notifications within your app  

    -> summary: to set up a test gmail account for less secure apps:  
        -> create a gmail account and enter account details  
        -> access settings and turn on "less secure apps"  
        -> enable two-factor authentication and create an app password
